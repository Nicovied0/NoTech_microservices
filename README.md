# NOT Microservice

This project was generated with `NODE` and `EXPRESS`.

## Development server

Run `npm i` to install dependencies, after run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/api/docs`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Utilization and Functionalities

This project can be used as a microservice to generate registration and authentication to profiles, you need to create a database to connect later. I recommend MONGO DB ATLAS. Then generate the .ENV file and its global variables. And modify the mongo file in the config folder, the DB_URI section with your global variables.
